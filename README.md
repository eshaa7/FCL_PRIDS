## 📌 Project Overview
**FCL-PRIDS** is a cybersecurity framework designed to detect anomalies in Industrial IoT (IIoT) networks. It utilizes a **1D-CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** to analyze traffic patterns without compromising data privacy.

## 📂 Dataset Info
**Note:** The Edge-IIoTset data (>2GB) is not included in this repo.
- Place your `.csv` or `.pcap` files in a folder named `data/` to run locally.
